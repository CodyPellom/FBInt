Data types: 
*Undefined
*Null
*Boolean
*String
*Symbol
*Number
*Object
-----------------------------------
JavaScript was invented in 1995 and was first used by the netscape browser
-----------------------------------
What are Arrow Functions? 
()=>{}

Arrow functions are a concise and short way to write finction expressions in Es6 and above. A row function cannot be used as constructors and also does not support the '.this' argument, super or new.target keywords. 

Ex: 
 const greet=()=>{console.log('hello');}
 greet();
-----------------------------------
Importing and Exporting 

The purpose of importing and exporting files in JavaScript is the ability to split code up into multiple files. Importing and exporting is also used for grabbing bits of code from JS libraries. 

Ex:
 //index.js

 import name,age from './person'; 

 console.log(name);
 console.log(age);

 //person.js

 let name ='Sharad', occupation='developer', age =26;

 export { name, age};
 ---------------------------------
Augmented Assignment Operators

There are also some shortcut operators available, called augmented assignment operators. For example, if you want to simply add a new text string to an existing one and return the result, you could do this:

name += ' says hello!';

this is equivalent to 

name = name + ' says hello!';
--------------------------------
Comparison Operator:

Used for true/false tests: 

Operator:  ===	
Name:  Strict equality (is it exactly the same?)
Ex:  5 === 2 + 4

Operator:  !==
Name:  Non-equality (is it not the same?)
Ex:  'Chris' !== 'Ch' + 'ris'

Operator:  <
Name:  Less than
Ex:  10 < 6

Operator:  >
Name:  Greater than
Ex:  10 > 20
--------------------------------
Loops 

ex:
for (let i = 1 ; i < 21 ; i++) { console.log(i) }


A starting value: In this case we are starting a count at 1, but this could be any number you like. You could replace the letter i with any name you like too, but i is used as a convention because it's short and easy to remember.

An exit condition: Here we have specified i < 21 â€” the loop will keep going until i is no longer less than 21. When i reaches 21, the loop will no longer run.

An incrementor: We have specified i++, which means "add 1 to i". The loop will run once for every value of i, until i reaches a value of 21 (as discussed above). In this case, we are simply printing the value of i out to the console on every iteration using console.log().
