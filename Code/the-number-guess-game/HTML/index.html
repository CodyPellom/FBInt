    <p>We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess it in 10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you if your guess was too high or too low.</p>

        <!-- The next two constants store references to the form text input and submit button and are used to control submitting the guess later on. -->
      <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label><input type="text" id="guessField" class="guessField">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit">
