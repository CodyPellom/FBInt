    <h1>Number guessing game</h1>

    <p>We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess it in 10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you if your guess was too high or too low.</p>

    <div class="form">
        <!-- The next two constants store references to the form text input and submit button and are used to control submitting the guess later on. -->
      <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label><input type="text" id="guessField" class="guessField">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit">
    </div>

    <div class="resultParas">
            <!-- The first three constants are each made to store a reference to the results paragraphs in our HTML, and are used to insert values into the paragraphs later on in the code: -->
      <p class="guesses"></p>
      <p class="lastResult"></p>
      <p class="lowOrHi"></p>

The simplest form of conditional block starts with the keyword if, then some parentheses, then some curly braces. Inside the parentheses we include a test.

If it is, the player has guessed correctly and the game is won, so we show the player a congratulations message with a nice green color, clear the contents of the Low/High guess information box, and run a function called setGameOver(), which we'll discuss later.

  } else {
    //The final block chained onto the end of this code (the else { }) contains code that is only run if neither of the other two tests returns true (i.e. the player didn't guess right, but they have more guesses left). In this case we tell them they are wrong, then we perform another conditional test to check whether the guess was higher or lower than the answer, displaying a further message as appropriate to tell them higher or lower.
    lastResult.textContent = 'Wrong!';

  //We add 1 to the guessCount variable so the player uses up their turn (++ is an incrementation operation â€” increment by 1), and empty the value out of the form text field and focus it again, ready for the next guess to be entered.
